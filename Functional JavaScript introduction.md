## Functional Programing

Functional programming (FP) is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of functions to perform computations. In FP, functions are treated as first-class citizens, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as values from functions. FP is based on the mathematical concept of a function, which maps inputs to outputs and has no side effects.

The principles of functional programming include:

1. Immutability: In FP, data is immutable, meaning that once it is created, it cannot be modified. Instead, new data structures are created based on existing ones.

1. Pure functions: Pure functions are functions that have no side effects and always return the same output for a given input. They do not modify any external state or variables, and they do not rely on external state or variables. Pure functions are deterministic and easy to reason about, test, and debug.

1. Higher-order functions: In FP, functions can take other functions as arguments and return functions as values. This allows for a higher level of abstraction and modularity in programming.

1. Recursion: Recursion is used extensively in FP to iterate over data structures and perform computations. Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself with a modified input, and it is often used to replace traditional loops in imperative programming.

1. Lazy evaluation: In FP, functions are evaluated lazily, meaning that they are only evaluated when their results are needed. This can lead to more efficient code, as it avoids unnecessary computations.

1. Overall, FP aims to create programs that are more concise, modular, and easier to reason about. It is particularly well-suited for parallel and distributed computing, as it minimizes shared state and mutable data.

### Differences between imperative and functional programming

Functional programming and imperative programming are two distinct programming paradigms that have different approaches to how code is structured, executed, and organized.

Imperative programming is a programming paradigm where the program is a sequence of statements that change the state of the program. Imperative programming is based on the idea of giving commands to the computer to perform specific actions, and the order in which those actions are executed is critical. Imperative programming is commonly associated with languages like C, C++, Java, and Python.

Functional programming, on the other hand, is a programming paradigm that focuses on the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. Functional programming emphasizes the use of functions and higher-order functions to solve problems, with less emphasis on the sequence of statements. Functional programming is commonly associated with languages like Haskell, Lisp, and F#.

Here are some differences between functional programming and imperative programming:

1. State management: In imperative programming, state management is crucial, as the program has to keep track of the state of the program and how it changes. In functional programming, state management is avoided as much as possible, as functions do not change the state of the program.

2. Control flow: Imperative programming relies on control structures such as loops and conditional statements to manage control flow. In functional programming, recursion and higher-order functions are used to manage control flow.

3. Mutation: In imperative programming, mutation of data is common, and data can be changed at any time. In functional programming, data is immutable, and once it is created, it cannot be changed.

4. Side effects: Imperative programming allows for side effects, which are changes made to the program outside of the intended behavior. Functional programming, on the other hand, avoids side effects as much as possible, as they can make the program unpredictable and difficult to understand.

5. Paradigm: Imperative programming is based on the idea of giving commands to the computer to perform specific actions. Functional programming is based on the idea of evaluating mathematical functions to solve problems.

#### Examples:

1. State management:

In imperative programming, it's common to use variables to keep track of the state of the program. For example, consider the following code:

```js
let sum = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  sum += i;
}
console.log(sum);
```

This code uses a variable `sum` to keep track of the running total, and a `for` loop to iterate over the numbers 0 through 9.

In functional programming, we would avoid changing variables and instead use functions to compute the result. For example, we could use the `reduce` method on an array to compute the sum of the numbers:

```js
const numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];
const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0);
console.log(sum);
```

This code uses the `reduce` method to iterate over the array and compute the sum. The `reduce` method takes a function that accumulates the values and returns the final result.

2. Mutation:

In imperative programming, it's common to mutate data structures like arrays and objects. For example, consider the following code:

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  numbers[i] = numbers[i] * 2;
}
console.log(numbers);
```

This code multiplies each element of the `numbers` array by 2 using a `for` loop.

In functional programming, we would avoid mutating data structures and instead create new ones. For example, we could use the `map` method on an array to create a new array with the values multiplied by 2:

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2);
console.log(doubled);
```

This code uses the `map` method to create a new array with the values multiplied by 2. The original `numbers` array is not mutated.

3. Side effects:

In imperative programming, it's common to have side effects like console output or modifying the DOM. For example, consider the following code:

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  console.log(numbers[i]);
}
```

This code logs each element of the `numbers` array to the console.

In functional programming, we would avoid side effects and instead return values from functions. For example, we could use the `forEach` method on an array to iterate over the values and call a function with each value:

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
numbers.forEach(num => console.log(num));
```

This code uses the `forEach` method to iterate over the `numbers` array and log each value to the console. However, the `forEach` method doesn't return a value and doesn't modify the original array.

## Javascript as a functional language

JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language, which means that it supports both object-oriented programming and functional programming. However the recent updates in JavaScript have made easier and more efficient to write functional code.

Functional programming in JavaScript involves creating function that take in data and return a new set of data, without modifying the original data. This is known as pure function, which do not have any side effects and are idempotent (they can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application).

In addition, functional programing also involves the use of higher-order functions, which are functions that take in other functions as arguments or return functions as results. These functions can be used to create more flexible and reusable code.

Other concepts in FP includes immutability, which involves creating immutable data structures that cannot be changed once they are created, and closures, which allow functions to access variables in their lexical environment after the have been executed.

Overall, functional programing in JavaScript can help to create more maintainable, scalable, and error-free code, which also make it easier to reason about and test.

## Functions in JavaScript

JavaScript functions have some differences compared to traditional functions in other languages. Here are some differences:

1. First-class functions: functions are considered first-class citizens, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as values from functions. This allows for powerful functional programming techniques that are not available in many other languages.

1. Dynamic Typing: JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means that the data type of a variable is determined at runtime. This also applies to function arguments and return types, which can be of any type, This is different from statically typed languages like Java or C++, where the data types must be explicitly defined. Typescript began its life as an attempt to bring traditional object-oriented types to JavaScript so that the programmers at Microsoft could bring traditional object-oriented program to the web. As it has developed, TS's type system has evolved to model code written by native JavaScripters. The resulting system is powerful, interesting and messy.

1. Closures: JavaScript supports closures, which are function that have access to variables in their outer scope, even after the outer scope has returned. This allows for powerful and flexible programming techniques, such as creating private variables or memoization.

1. Function hoisting: In JavaScript, function declarations are hoisted to the top or their scope, meaning they can be called before they are defined. This is not possible in many other languages, where functions must be defined before they are used.

These differences make JavaScript functions unique and powerful, but they also require a different way of thinking about programming compared to traditional functions in other languages.

## Higher-order functions

A higher-order function is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments and or returns a function as its result. In other words, it's a function that operates on other functinos,

Higher-order functions can be used to compose programs in JavaScript by allowing us to create more abstract and reusable code. Here are some examples:

1. Function composition: by passing functions as arguments to other functions, we can compose them into more complex functions. For example, we can write a functino that takes two functions and returns a new function that applies the first function to the result of the second function.

1. Callback functions: HOF are often used to pass callbacks to other functions, which can then be executed at a later time. This is commonly used in asynchronous programming, where we want to perform some action once a tsak has completed.

1. Partial application or currying: HOF can be also used for partial application and currying, which involve creating new functions by applying arguments to existing functions. This can be useful for creating more specialized functions from more general ones.

1. Function decorators: HOF can be used to create function decorators, which are functions that take another functions and add functionality to it. This is a common technique for adding logging, error handling, or caching to existing functions.

Overall, higher-order functions are a powerful tool in JavaScript that allow us to create more flexible and composable code. By understanding and utilizing them effectively, we can write cleaner and more maintainable programs.

## Closures

A closure is created when a function is defined inside another function, allowing the inner function to access the outer function's variables and parameters even after the outer function has returned.

Closures can be used to create private variables and functions in JavaScript. This is achieved by defining a variable or function inside a function that is not returned, meaning it cannot be accessed from outised the function.

For example:

```js
const secretPassword() {
  const password = '077E2FA27'; // Password can not be accessed from the outer scopes
  return ({
    guessPassword: (guess) => guess === password
  })
}

const passwordGame = secretePassword();
passwordGame.guessPassword('undeuxtroisuiop') // false
passwordGame.guessPassword('DEADBEEF'); // false
passwordGame.guessPassword('077E2FA27'); // true
```

## Immutability

In JavaScript, immutable data refers to data that cannot be modified after it is created. This means that once an immutable data object is created, any attempt to change it will create a new object rather than modify the existing one. 

The concept of immutable data is important for creating predictable and stable code because it prevents unexpected changes to data and reduces the likelihood of bugs caused by unintended modifications. Immutable data also makes it easier to reason about the state of an application at any given point in time because the data is guaranteed to remain constant.

There are several ways to create immutable data in JavaScript, such as using the Object.freeze() method or using immutable data libraries like Immutable.js. For example, Object.freeze() can be used to prevent changes to an object like this:

```js
const myObject = Object.freeze({ 
  name: 'Patrick', 
  age: 30 
});

// Attempting to modify the object will fail silently
myObject.age = 31;
console.log(myObject.age); // Output: 30
```

Immutable data can also be used in functional programming, where pure functions are used to transform immutable data without changing the original data. This approach makes it easier to reason about the behavior of the code and reduces the likelihood of side effects.

Overall, using immutable data in JavaScript can help create more predictable and stable code by preventing unintended modifications to data and making it easier to reason about the state of an application.

## Recursion

Recursion is a programming concept where a function calls itself repeatedly until a certain condition is met. In JavaScript, recursion can be used to solve complex problems that involve iterating over nested data structures or performing multiple operations on a set of data.

To understand recursion in JavaScript, let's consider an example of a factorial function that calculates the factorial of a given number. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number. For instance, the factorial of 4 is 4\*3\*2*1, which is equal to 24.

Here's how a recursive function can be used to calculate the factorial of a number:

```js
function factorial(n) {
  if (n === 1) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
  }
}
```

In this function, we first check if the input `n` is equal to 1. If it is, we return 1, which is the base case for the recursion. If `n` is not equal to 1, we recursively call the `factorial` function with `n - 1` as the input and multiply the result with `n`. This continues until `n` becomes equal to 1, at which point the recursion stops and the final result is returned.

Recursion can also be used to traverse nested data structures such as trees and graphs. For instance, consider a binary search tree that contains a set of numbers. To find a specific number in the tree, we can use a recursive function that compares the input number with the current node value and calls itself on either the left or right subtree depending on the comparison result. This process continues until the number is found or the search reaches the end of the tree.

Overall, recursion is a powerful programming concept that can simplify complex problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and solving them recursively. However, it's important to be careful when using recursion to avoid infinite loops and stack overflow errors.

## Practice and examples

1. Use Pure Functions: A pure function is a function that returns the same output for the same input and has no side effects. This means that it does not modify any variables outside of its own scope. Using pure functions makes it easier to reason about the behavior of your code and avoid unexpected bugs. 

Example of a pure function:

```js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

2. Avoid Mutating State: Instead of modifying existing data, create new data structures that represent the updated state. This can be done using techniques such as immutable data structures, object spread syntax, and array methods such as map and filter.

Example of avoiding mutating state:

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const doubledNumbers = numbers.map(num => num * 2); // Creates a new array instead of modifying the original array
```

3. Use Higher-Order Functions: Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as their output. They can be used to create more reusable and composable code.

Example of using a higher-order function:

```js
function multiplyBy(factor) {
  return function(num) {
    return num * factor;
  }
}

const double = multiplyBy(2);
const triple = multiplyBy(3);

console.log(double(5)); // Output: 10
console.log(triple(5)); // Output: 15
```

4. Use Function Composition: Function composition is the act of combining functions to create more complex functionality. This can be done using techniques such as the pipe and compose functions.

Example of using function composition:

```js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

function multiplyBy(factor) {
  return function(num) {
    return num * factor;
  }
}

const addAndDouble = (a, b) => multiplyBy(2)(add(a, b)); // Combines the add and multiplyBy functions

console.log(addAndDouble(2, 3)); // Output: 10
```

5. Use Recursion: Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. It can be used to create elegant and concise solutions to complex problems.

Example of using recursion:

```js
function factorial(num) {
  if (num === 0) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return num * factorial(num - 1);
  }
}

console.log(factorial(5)); // Output: 120
```
